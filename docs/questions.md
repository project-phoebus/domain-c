# Deferred questions for the owner

Decisions taken conservatively while working unattended; each can be
revisited.

1. Commit trailers: commits end with a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line.
   Keep or drop?
2. Placement of the prelude's foreign declarations (2026-11-10): no
   copy of glob_extern, real_globals, real_externals or the
   globals_from_* inserts survives, so each routine or cell a prelude
   unit needs and no other insert it opens could declare was placed by
   origin (front end, back end, other lang/lang units; real-arithmetic
   externals in real_externals; lib_ in us/us/ins/lib.ins.pas);
   glob_extern, its derived object and real_globals are left empty.
   The rule is in globals_from_backend.ins.pas.  Revisit if a listing or
   an insert turns up.
3. cargs_$options_t (cargs.ins.pas): four groups are sets and the rest
   booleans and subranges, on the evidence of Rev 8.89 merging
   consecutive constant stores (docs/rev889-patterns.md 10).  If the
   original used more sets (for example for the +0x27A..+0x27B and
   +0x28A..+0x28B flags), only the declarations change, not the layout.
4. IL nodes read by offset (translator C, 2026-11-10): il_utils and
   gen_utils read many node kinds (tree nodes 137..233, variables 109
   and 110, blocks 105 and 172, sections 182 and 183, address constants
   163 and 195, ...) whose variants nobody has named yet.  Rather than
   invent per-kind variants, il.ins.pas got generic views by offset
   (xp[k], xl[k] at +4k; xp2[k], xl2[k] at +4k+2; xw[k] at +2k; xc[k] at
   +k), the convention of IL's globals.  Replace them with named
   variants as the kinds are identified, or prefer per-kind variants
   now?
5. tools/coff_compare.py and tools/cc_check.sh pick a binary's unit by
   its path (--unit lang/lang/source/token): two units are named
   token.pas, and the gate skipped lang/lang/source/token.pas silently
   (`no single unit').  The change belongs in the source repository's
   coff_compare.py too when it is merged back.
