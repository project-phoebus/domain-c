# Deferred questions for the owner

Decisions taken conservatively while working unattended; each can be
revisited.

1. Commit trailers: commits end with a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line.
   Keep or drop?
2. Placement of the prelude's foreign declarations (2026-11-10): no
   copy of glob_extern, real_globals, real_externals or the
   globals_from_* inserts survives, so each routine or cell a prelude
   unit needs and no other insert it opens could declare was placed by
   origin (front end, back end, other lang/lang units; real-arithmetic
   externals in real_externals; lib_ in us/us/ins/lib.ins.pas);
   glob_extern, its derived object and real_globals are left empty.
   The rule is in globals_from_backend.ins.pas.  Revisit if a listing or
   an insert turns up.
3. cargs_$options_t (cargs.ins.pas): four groups are sets and the rest
   booleans and subranges, on the evidence of Rev 8.89 merging
   consecutive constant stores (docs/rev889-patterns.md 10).  If the
   original used more sets (for example for the +0x27A..+0x27B and
   +0x28A..+0x28B flags), only the declarations change, not the layout.
